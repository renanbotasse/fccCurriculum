# FreeCodeCamp Curriculum

In this repository, I save all my exercises and projects from [FreeCodeCamp Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn). 

You will not see a lot of information explaining the exercises here, but you can make the same courses and search on the [forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/) for the explanations.

I started to study at FCC at the beginning of 2022, and I already finish the following courses:
- JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- Front End Development Libraries
- Responsive Web Desing
- Back End Development and APIs

After that, I focus in pass through the 42 Piscine (Porto) and making some real projects. 

These three first certifications mean a lot to me, this is the start of my journey as a developer. 

Until the end of 2023 I will finish these other courses:
- Data Visualization
- Relational Database
- Quality Assurance
- Information Security
